  In the dipolar mechanism, the source of the local field is the magnetic moments of other nuclear spins in the sample. Unpaired electrons also generate local fields in an analogous way, and so are a potential source of relaxation. The magnetic moment of the electron is very much greater than that of the proton, so the local field generated by an electron is correspondingly much greater. Unpaired electrons can, therefore, be a particularly efficient source of relaxation, causing a significant effect even when present at low concentrations.
