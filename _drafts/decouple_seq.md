### decoupling from James Keeler's 2014 lecture

1. Heteronuclear broadband decoupling
  a broad-band decoupling sequence applied to the *I* spins effecitvely sets all heteronuclear couplings to the *S*-spins to zero. the folloing are likely to be dephased: *I*-spin coherences, anti-phase term on *I*, z-magnetization on *I*.

2. Semi-selective decoupling
  by deliberately reducing the RF power level it's possible to restrict the ecoupling effect to a narrower range of shifts.

### spin-locking
1. continuous wave field (CW)
  limt the spectral width covered wth CW excitation.
2. composite pulse
