### Tricks from James Keeler's lecture

1. The first pulse can only generate p = +- 1 from equilibrium magnetization, so no need to phase cycle this pulse.
2. Group pulses together and cycle as a unit.
3. Only p = -1 is observable, so it does not matter if other values of p are generated by the last pulse. Also no need to phase cycle the last pulse, if a coherence order has been selected unambiguously before this pulse.
4. Donot worry about high orders of multiple quantum coherence.

Refocusing pulses (EXORCYCLE), pulse [0, 1, 2, 3] and rx [0, 2, 0, 2]

Axial peak suppression, 1st pulse [0, 2] and rx [0, 2]

CYCLOPS: pulse [0, 1, 2, 3] and rx [0, 1, 2, 3]

A gradient depahses all coherences except homonuclear zero-quantum, called a purge gradient or homospoil.
